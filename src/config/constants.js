Tipping doesn’t usually cost more than 20% of the total cost of the move unless, of course, you’re an extremely generous tipper.Point to note: You should always tip everyone the same amount of money per hour, be it the movers or the lead workers. Unequal tipping can lead to dissatisfaction amongst the crew members. With GetMovers, making more money in tips should depend more on the number of hours worked and not the position worked.',

On the other hand, art forms, such as paintings, might not seem as breakable, but they are much more prone to damage from other factors such as heat, light or smudging.Furthermore, dealing with such pieces often means handling an object that is simply not replaceable, for instance, a family heirloom. Hence, pottery or art of any kind must be handled very carefully on every step of the moving journey from the initial wrap to the final unloading.',

When planning a move, be sure to educate yourself on the gun safety and relocation laws of the intended location before making a move.',
